# CS50
Coursework for Harvard's CS50. One of my favorite classes I've ever taken and a wonderful community behind it.

All solutions are to the "more comfortable", i.e. harder, problem sets. I got through the bulk of the course, completing the portion taught in C and a bit of Python in pset6. Sadly I had to put this on this project on the back burner once I entered college for a real computer science degree.
